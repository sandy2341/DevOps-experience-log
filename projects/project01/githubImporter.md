GitHub Importer Guide

GitHub provides a built-in GitHub Importer tool that allows you to migrate repositories from other version control platforms like GitLab, Bitbucket, or even another GitHub account with ease.

Steps to Use GitHub Importer:

Go to GitHub Importer

Navigate to GitHub Importer.

The import option is available when you create a new repository or visit the Importer tool directly.

Enter Repository URL

Provide the URL of the source repository you want to import:

Source Repository: https://github.com/sandy2341/DevOps-experience-log

Ensure you have the necessary access permissions to the source repository.

Select Destination Repository

GitHub will automatically fetch the repository details.

Choose the name for the new repository in GitHub:

Destination Repository: https://github.com/DevOps-Project-Workshops/GitHubMigrations.git

Configure repository visibility (Public/Private).

Start Import Process

Click on Begin Import to initiate the migration.

The process may take a few minutes depending on the repository size.

Verify the Imported Repository

Once the import is complete, navigate to the new repository.

Ensure that history, branches, and files have been imported correctly.
